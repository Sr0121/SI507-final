UMich SI 507 Final Project

In this project, we are trying to build a program to help people search for the movie information. Users can use this program to search movies by genre, crew name or even cast name, and can choose the movie to see the detail of it. In addition, if the user searches by cast name, the program will return at most 40 different names associated with that name as the suggestions.
